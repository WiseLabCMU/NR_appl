I bridge theory and practice in modern Cyber-Physical Systems. %CPS. Modern cyber-physical systems require theoreticians and practitioners to work together.
Theoreticians often abstract away relevant aspects of the problem to achieve elegant results and prove important properties about their analysis and design. While some insight can still be drawn from these advancements, they usually leave a wide gap that the system designer needs to fill in order to have a working implementation. Unreliabilities occur as a consequence of unrealistic assumptions and inefficiencies arise as a consequence of non trivial constraints imposed by the real-world and finally cost is rarely taken into account. On the other hand, a complete bottom-up approach, based usually on experience and domain knowledge, is non scalable as intuition tends to fade in the face of scale and complexity. I strive to introduce systematic design principles into networked embedded sensing systems with the goal of designing inference algorithms that can achieve high reliability, cost-effectiveness and performance in Cyber-Physical Systems. Differently from both pure theoreticians and practitioners, I work close to the physical layer, and I understand its practical constraints, which I include in my models. As a consequence, my systematic approach takes advantage of the peculiar structure of the system and provides solutions that not only are near optimal according to the chosen design metric, but also readily implementable. Knowledge of the system allows me to perform opportunistic design, by extracting useful information from sensors and devices deployed for other purposes. \\

My thesis demonstrates this approach applied to several indoor localization applications, ranging from precise mobile phone localization that can be used for navigation and mobile augmented reality, to extreme systems designed for firefighting scenarios wherein multiple incomplete sources of data need to be opportunistically fused together. 
In all of this, not only did I develop algorithms that provide performance guarantees, but I also demonstrated the feasibility of my design in several real world deployments.
%In all of this, not only did I develop algorithms that provide performance guarantees, but I also demonstrated the feasibility of my design in several real world deployments.

\section{Indoor Localization Research}

GPS has revolutionized the way we interact with the outdoor environment.  % by providing location service. 
%Several solutions, like GPS, have emerged in the past decade for localizing mobile devices. 
Yet we don't have pervasive and accurate systems for indoor localization.  
%It is unclear if a single technology will emerge that can solve all indoor localization problems, because of the wide variability in application requirements and the constraints imposed by indoor spaces.  
It is impossible for a single technology to solve all indoor localization problems, because of the wide variation in application requirements and indoor spaces.  At the same time, it is impractical to deploy several different localization systems in all buildings at global scale. %I believe, we require a systematic approach to obtain %An ideal 
%It is unclear if a single technology will emerge that can solve all indoor localization problems, because of the wide variability in application requirements and indoor spaces.  
Working between theory and systems allows me to solve this problem in a unique manner. I have built novel platforms by opportunistically designing new sensing and signaling schemes by exploiting low-level properties of sensors. I have built opportunistic estimation methods that can accurately localize give insufficient information, while traditional estimation techniques would fail. Finally, I have bridged theory and practice by building tools that  allow system installers to deploy infrastructure in a quantifiable manner. 

%My approach is to solve this problem opportunistically - to do the best with what is available. %By being opportunistic, these systems use the available devices in the environment, 
%First, I opportunistically use infrastructure (smart lighting, smart speakers, emerging internet-of-things) in novel ways to obtain location information. Second, I opportunistically integrate the available sensor sources in novel ways to get more information with less data. \\
%However, the opportunistic approach will only work when we have the minimal infrastructure required in place. Third, I build tools that can guide users to place the minimal required infrastructure and enable them to know what information they can get from the available infrastructure. Finally, I build tools for localization with where there is no fixed infrastructure. I describe these below. 

\paragraph{New Hardware Platforms . }

I designed one of the earliest visible light communication (VLC) systems to send data from overhead LED lights to phones. The phones use proximity to lights in order to determine their location.  The challenge in building this communication channel is that in order for the lights to be flicker-free, they have to operate at a much higher frequency that the camera frame rate. % is much lower than the light's operating frequency. 
To overcome this, my insight was to exploit the low-level rolling-shutter effect of camera sensors to capture frequencies higher than the frame rate, %a time-varying light signal as a spatially varying image 
 and to use the exposure and focus control as filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio \cite{rajagopal2014visual, rajagopal2014demonstration}. I extended this to design a novel hybrid communication system for camera and photodiodes \cite{rajagopal2014hybrid}. 
%The proposed approaches generalizes to any LED-camera communication system and have been cited 170+ times. Subsequently the field of VLC has grown significantly in both academia and industry.

I contributed to building an ultrasonic time-of-flight (ToF) platform that localizes unmodified mobile devices \cite{rtas-alps-platform, lazik2015alps,lazik2015alpsdemo}.  I have worked with Apple on emerging WiFi ToF, with Texas Instruments on emerging Bluetooth Low Energy 5 ToF, and with commodity ultra-wideband ToF systems. I realized that ToF ranging is promising for localization and will eventually find its way into future smart devices.  However, these systems face challenges in scaling up, with respect to location estimation and system setup. \textit{I then tackled these challenges.} 


\paragraph{New Estimation Algorithms. } 
%I designed sensor fusion methods to acquire location and orientation accurately under practical conditions. 
Location estimation is typically done in two stages. An initial location is first acquired and over time the location is updated with new measurements. 
%Location estimation has two stages - initialization or acquisition, and location updates when we have a prior. 
Acquiring the initial location with ToF systems is challenging in the real world, since we often have only few line-of-sight (LOS) ranges and several incorrect non-line-of-light (NLOS) ranges. Further, we don't have ways to acquire orientation instantly. 

While past approaches deploy too many beacons, or require the user to walk around before the location converges, I designed a new solver that localizes with just two LOS beacons rather than three (for 2D localization). It maintains the same performance with high NLOS \cite{rajagopal2018enhancing}.  %This tackles the practical problem at scale of having too few line-of-sight ranges and having incorrect non-line-of-light ranges. 
My main insight was that we can integrate the floor plan while solving and use the absence of measurements from beacons as useful information. 
This significantly reduces the amount of infrastructure and increases robustness of the system. 
%I implemented this in our system that won the Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition in 2015.
This solver implemented on our ultrasonic platform won the Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition in 2015. %A second practical problem is that beacon-based systems cannot estimate device orientation. 

Acquiring orientation on phones is hard since the magnetic field is unreliable indoors. To solve this problem, 
%Applications like navigation and augmented reality require orientation in addition to location. 
I designed a novel approach %using beac. % to acquire orientation. %The challenge is that the magnetic field is unreliable indoors. 
%My insight was that 
where we %we could 
crowd-source a dense magnetic field map with mobile pedestrians by fusing data from beacons, on-board camera and inertial sensors. 
Subsequently, we leverage this map as a reference for instantly acquiring orientation upon startup. %without requiring a user to walk around before they can start using the application. 
Using this concept, we built an end-to-end multi-user persistent augmented reality (AR) system \cite{mobileAR}. This work won best demo award at IPSN 2018 \cite{rajagopal2018welcome}. I extended this work to support continuous location updates. This system won the Microsoft Indoor Localization competition in 2018 with ultra-wideband beacons. 

These approaches are implemented on our ultrasonic localization system that spawned into a startup. A pilot has been deployed for AR-based product finding in a retail store. 

\paragraph{From Theory to Practice.  }
Beacon setup at scale lacks a systematic method, is laborious and time-consuming, and does not adapt over time. %This hinders scaling up of systems in cost-effective ways. % to scaling up. %scaling in cost-effective ways.

To bring order to the deployment chaos, I designed systematic beacon placement algorithms \cite{rajagopal2016beacon}. 
My first insight was to use the floor plan geometry in a clever way to reduce the number of beacons compared to conventional placement. 
My second insight was to quantify the quality of a beacon placement by adopting the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the location estimate, which is captured by the geometry of beacons. I built on these concepts and implemented beacon placement algorithms in a toolchain where system installers can specify accuracy and coverage requirements for a floor plan and obtain a placement. 

While working on this, I found that we could apply computation geometry theory to solve these problems in a rigorous manner.  
I started collaborating with Prof. Jie Gao from Stony Brook University and her student. 
We mathematically formulated the beacon placement problem and proposed algorithms with provable guarantees \cite{beaconplacementtheory}.  

%A complementary problem in beacon setup is to first place them and then infer their locations.  
To solve the complementary problem where we first place beacons and then map their locations, I built on algorithms in robotics and designed a pedestrian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm \cite{mobileAR}. We implemented this in the real world for mapping ultra-wideband beacons and for asset tracking with BLE tags. 

user requirements. In order to understand the real pain points of end-users of localization, I attended a conference on mobile positioning in museums. 

\paragraph{Other Areas in CPS. }
I have also contributed to time-synchronization \cite{buevich2013hardware, dongare2017pulsar} and non-intrusive electrical load
monitoring \cite{rajagopal2013magnetic, rajagopal2013demo}.

\section{Future Work}
In the long-term I want to design resource-efficient systems and paradigms to go from sensor data to inference for emerging cyber-physical systems.
In the near-term I want to build theoretical and practical frameworks for secure, reliable end-to-end location aware systems that are integrated with next generation communication systems and support seamless interaction with objects and smart devices indoors. 
%solve problems more broadly in sensing, communication and designing more secure systems. 

\paragraph{Localization for First Responders. }
%My vision for mobile indoor localization is that the future we will have a variety of technologies that operate together 
%In contrast to mobile indoor localization for augmented reality, another direction I pursued was localization under challenging environments.  
%I led the proposal for a firefighter localization research project, which is funded by National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST). This problem is challenging since we cannot rely on any existing infrastructure. Our proposed method uses beacons deployed on firetrucks and wearable devices on firefighters, in combination with mobile network localization algorithms. I am exploring several research directions ahead, with challenges in sensing, system design and algorithms, in order for the approach to scale across buildings and be reliable in the worst firefighting scenarios. 
%In addition, a future direction is to integrate a network of drones for increasing resilience.

Our proposed method uses beacons on firetrucks, wearable devices on firefighters, a long-range low-power wireless network, and mobile network localization and mapping algorithms.

%Our proposed system is a combination of fixed beacons on firetrucks and firefighters with wearable devices. The challenge in estimation is that we have insufficient and sporadic sources of information. 
%As an extension to the proposed method, on the system side we are exploring the possibility of placing low-power beacons within exit signs in buildings, and on the algorithms side we are exploring using visual-inertial odometry to train  training modelscommodity inertial sensors using higher-fidelity sensors. 
%Our proposed system is a combination of fixed beacons on firetrucks that are automatically mapped using our SLAM algorithm; firefighters with wearable devices that range to each other; and estimation algorithms based on mobile network localization. We are exploring the possibility of exit signs as potential locations for low-power beacons in emergencies. 

\paragraph{Secure Localization. }
%Indoor localization is imminent. However, c
Current indoor localization systems can easily be attacked and locations can be spoofed. It is critical to make these systems secure for them to be usable. Secure location-awareness is also important to enable device discovery and interaction in the internet-of-things with heterogeneous untrusted devices.
%Security and localization are siloed domains traditionally. However, there is an opportunity in working across the domains to make localization secure, and to leverage localization and sensing for enabling secure interaction among physically co-located devices. 
%To start thinking about localization from a security-point-of-view, 
My early conversations with a security research group suggest that we have to re-think all layers of the localization stack starting from the physical layer design, to the location estimation, and infrastructure setup algorithms. %can re-design various layers of the system stack for security, ranging from the low-level signals, to the localization and beacon placement algorithms.  
%that we have to re-design I have started working on problems in secure localization with a security research group. % 
%n order to  started collaborating As a start, I visited a security research group for a week and started 
%re-designing looking at how the ToF localization stack I have designed would change for these systems to be robust to certain physical layer attacks. 
%I am analyzing how to re-design the location estimation algorithms and the beacon placement algorithms for robustness to certain physical layer attacks. 
A preliminary direction for physical layer security is to use multiple sensor sources and check for consistency among them since they have different physical properties and attack models. %More broadly, I want to design future sensing systems to be secure. %A preliminary direction is that we can check for consistency among different sensors physical layer properties.

\paragraph{Next-Generation Communication and Localization. }
Location-awareness in next-generation communication systems can enable better use of the
spectrum by sensing the location of users, predicting channel characteristics, predicting connectivity and by creating reconfigurable arrays with mobile agents. 
Localization and imaging techniques using mmWave technology can benefit localization, indoor mapping and communication indoors.  %I am also interested in algorithms for accurate localization and tracking of mobile devices to improve resource allocation and channel prediction for communication systems. %For instance, location tracking and mobility models can predict channel characteristics and enable beam tracking. %At larger scales,

To solve problems in this space, I can draw from my experience of working across layers of the system stack and my geometry-based methods for indoor localization. \\

\paragraph{Mixed Reality. }
Mixed reality is promising for interacting with future smart devices and to close the digital-physical loop in real-time. It requires accurate representation of the digital display, smart devices and physical objects in the same reference frame, for which current vision-based methods are insufficient.
I would develop design principles for fusing multiple sensors, such as vision, emerging localization technologies, and VLC at the low-level to create robust mixed reality systems. As a start, I have shown how we can improve state-of-the-art mobile Augmented Reality (AR) using beacons and magnetic fields \cite{mobileAR}. % and I am collaborating on a VLC-based approach for discovering AR content. 


\paragraph{New Applications and New Paradigms. }
I want to enable a future where we use minimal resources to go from smart devices to meaningful applications. 
%I will continue to tackle problems across theory and systems to design practical and reliable CPS applications. 
With large amounts of sensor data, resource constraints on embedded devices, privacy challenges, and diverse end-applications that make	 inferences from the same data, we require new paradigms for 
sensor data processing at the edge. % and sensing and system models that are suitable for edge devices. % I would explore efficient paradigms for processing sensor data at the edge, and in developing embedded machine learning algorithms for sensor data processing. 
I am interested in tackling challenges for new application domains that are moving towards `smarts' - such as healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture and training. 
I believe I can apply my approach of working across the system stack and working across theory and systems %designing embedded sensing systems, system models, design tools, and estimation algorithms to these domains where there is tremendous diversity in the sensors, devices, and application requirements. I will continue 
%to tackle problems that span theory and systems 
to tackle the challenges of designing practical and reliable cyber-physical systems. 

\section{Building my Research Group}
I plan to have a large interdisciplinary research group. Irrespective of how students balance theory and practice in their work, my goal is for them to have a systematic analytical approach to design and an appreciation for practical real-world implementation. I will raise funds to setup a lab that has all the hardware and infrastructure resources required for building and evaluating systems, and grow the lab over time. I take a holistic approach to my research. While working on indoor localization, I interned at Apple's location group, worked with Texas Instruments emerging localization technology, and met with users of localization systems ranging from firefighters to museum staff who wanted to deploy localization systems. These interactions helped me think about the problem more holistically.  I will continue to keep my work grounded in real-world problems. I am looking forward to diversifying into new domains with collaborations.  \\

My style of working is collaborative, I am co-advised and I have had the opportunity to be part of two research groups during my PhD. One of my external collaborations started off with a casual discussion with a faculty at a conference, and another collaboration started off when I met a faculty who visited CMU to give a talk. % and I would encourage my students to collaborate with faculty and students in other research groups. 
In addition, I have been part of two SRC multi-university large research centers, Terraswarm and CONIX throughout my PhD. Being part of these research centers has given me the opportunity to experience first-hand the impact of collaborations across groups and universities, and build a wide network. I will create opportunities for my students to grow through such collaborations and interactions within and outside the university.  \\

Each student is unique and I will adapt my style of working to each student. %I will build a group where each student can define their own path during their PhD. 
I had the opportunity to see my work spawn into a startup, have worked full-time in both a multi-national and a small-sized organization, have collaborated with industry research labs, and I am choosing an academic path. With this diverse career background, I will create an environment that supports each student's own personal and interests and goals. That said, the common goal is for students to become independent thinkers and researchers. %I will create research opportunities for undergraduate and masters students as well. I would also like to engage 
 Overall, I will create a group where students grow professionally and personally.\\

%Given the nature of my work, spanning theory and systems, 
I am confident of securing funding from industry and government agencies to build my group.
