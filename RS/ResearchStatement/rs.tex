I am interested in designing embedded sensing systems and inference
algorithms for modern cyber-physical systems (CPS).  I leverage
theoretical frameworks from signal processing and estimation and apply
them to the complexities that arise from real-world sensing systems.
{\bf long convoluted sentence, phrases somewhat disconnected--- } I work
close to the physical layer, and I understand the practical
constraints, the interaction between signals and systems from first
principles, and the theoretical tools relevant to the problem.  The
balance between systems and theory in my work positions me extremely
well to tackle \st{the} important challenges in designing systems that are
practical, cost-effective, efficient, and reliable. My thesis
demonstrates this approach applied to several indoor localization
applications, ranging from \st{extremely} high precision mobile phone localization
that can be used for navigation and mobile augmented reality, to \st{more}
extreme systems designed for firefighting scenarios wherein multiple
incomplete sources of data need to be opportunistically fused
together.

% \paragraph{Old Intro: }
% My research lies at the intersection between embedded systems, estimation theory, and signal processing applied to Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications.  From a sensing and estimation perspective, the challenge in CPS is in dealing with heterogeneity in sensing across a large number of devices and the lack of a systematic way to go from sensor data to inference. I tackle this challenge by developing an understanding of the practical constraints, the theoretical tools relevant to the problem and a first principles understanding of the interaction between sensors, signals and systems. I then apply these constraints to the design of embedded sensing systems, system models and inference algorithms. My thesis demonstrates this approach applied to several indoor localization applications ranging from extremely precise mobile phone ranging that can be used for way-finding and mobile augmented reality to more extreme systems designed for firefighting scenarios where multiple incomplete sources of data need to be opportunistically fused together.

\section{Indoor Localization Research}


Several solutions, like GPS, have emerged in the past decade for localizing mobile devices. Yet there is still no pervasive and accurate system for indoors.  
%It is unclear if a single technology will emerge that can solve all indoor localization problems, because of the wide variability in application requirements and the constraints imposed by indoor spaces.  
It is unclear if a single technology will emerge that can solve all
indoor localization problems, because of the wide variability in
application requirements and indoor spaces.  Across solutions, there
is a trade-off between cost of infrastructure and setup, and
performance, in terms of accuracy and time taken for the location to
converge. I take an alternate approach where I derive insights that
cut across the sensing, embedded systems, and estimation stack. I
jointly explore emerging localization technologies, the location
estimation algorithms as well as tackle the challenges of system
setup.
%My work has explored new techologies, location estimation algorithms as well as tackled the challenges of system setup. 
%My approach is to design emerging technologies and the location estimation algorithms and system setup tools to enable them at scale in the real-world. 
%To this end, my work has explored multiple emerging technologies in terms of estimating location as well as the challenges of configuration and setup.


\paragraph{Emerging Technologies. }

I designed one of the earliest visible light communication (VLC)
systems to send data from overhead LED lights to phones. The phones
localize themselves to be in proximity of the lights detected. The
challenge in building this communication channel is that the camera
frame rate is much lower than the light's operating frequency.  To
overcome this, my insight was to exploit the low-level rolling-shutter
effect of camera sensors to capture frequencies higher than the frame
rate, the exposure and focus control as filters to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio \cite{rajagopal2014visual,
  rajagopal2014demonstration}. I extended this to design a novel
hybrid communication system for camera and photodiodes
\cite{rajagopal2014hybrid}.
 %a time-varying light signal as a spatially varying image and to use
%The proposed approaches generalizes to any LED-camera communication system and have been cited 170+ times. Subsequently the field of VLC has grown significantly in both academia and industry.

I contributed to building an ultrasonic time-of-flight (ToF) platform
that localizes unmodified mobile devices \cite{rtas-alps-platform,
  lazik2015alps,lazik2015alpsdemo}.  I have worked with Apple on
emerging WiFi ToF, with Texas Instruments on emerging Bluetooth Low
Energy 5 ToF, and with commodity ultra-wideband ToF systems. I
realized that ToF ranging is promising for localization and is
\st{getting} being integrated into future smart devices.  However,
they face challenges in scaling up, with respect to location
estimation and system setup. I then tackled these challenges.


\paragraph{Estimation Algorithms. } 
%I designed sensor fusion methods to acquire location and orientation accurately under practical conditions. 
Location estimation is done in two stages. An initial location is first acquired and over time the location is updated with new measurements. 
%Location estimation has two stages - initialization or acquisition, and location updates when we have a prior. 
Acquiring the initial location with ToF systems is challenging in the real world, since we often have only few line-of-sight (LOS) ranges and several incorrect non-line-of-light (NLOS) ranges. Further, we don't have ways to acquire orientation instantly. 

I designed a novel solver that localizes with just two LOS beacons rather than three (for 2D localization). It maintains the same performance with high NLOS \cite{rajagopal2018enhancing}.  %This tackles the practical problem at scale of having too few line-of-sight ranges and having incorrect non-line-of-light ranges. 
My main insight was that we can integrate the floor plan while solving and use the absence of measurements from beacons as useful information. 
This significantly reduces the amount of infrastructure and increases robustness of the system. 
%I implemented this in our system that won the Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition in 2015.
This solver implemented on our ultrasonic platform won the Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition in 2015. %A second practical problem is that beacon-based systems cannot estimate device orientation. 

Acquiring orientation on phones is hard since the magnetic field is unreliable indoors. To solve this problem, 
%Applications like navigation and augmented reality require orientation in addition to location. 
I designed a novel approach %using beac. % to acquire orientation. %The challenge is that the magnetic field is unreliable indoors. 
%My insight was that  %we could 
\st{where we}
that crowd-sources from a dense magnetic field map with mobile pedestrians by fusing data from beacons, on-board camera and inertial sensors. 
Subsequently, we leverage this map as a reference for instantly acquiring orientation upon startup. %without requiring a user to walk around before they can start using the application. 
Using this concept, we built an end-to-end multi-user persistent augmented reality (AR) system \cite{mobileAR}. This work won best demo award at IPSN 2018 \cite{rajagopal2018welcome}. I extended this work to support continuous location updates. This system won the Microsoft Indoor Localization competition in 2018 with ultra-wideband beacons. 

These approaches are implemented on our ultrasonic localization system that spawned into a startup. A pilot has been deployed for AR-based product finding in a retail store. 

\paragraph{Tools for Scalable Setup of Systems.  }
Beacon setup at scale lacks a systematic method, is laborious and time-consuming, and does not adapt over time. This hinders scaling up of systems in cost-effective ways. % to scaling up. %scaling in cost-effective ways.

To bring order to the deployment chaos, I designed systematic beacon
placement algorithms \cite{rajagopal2016beacon}.  My first insight was
to use the floor plan geometry in a clever way to reduce the number of
beacons compared to conventional placement.  My second insight was to
quantify the quality of a beacon placement by adopting the Cramer-Rao
lower bound on the location estimate, which is captured by the
geometry of beacons. I built on these concepts and implemented beacon
placement algorithms in a toolchain where system installers can
specify accuracy and coverage requirements for a floor plan and obtain
a placement.

While working on this, I found that we could apply \st{theory in}
computation geometry theory to solve these problems in a rigorous manner.  I
started collaborating with Prof. Jie Gao's team from Stony Brook University
\st{and her student}.  We mathematically formulated the beacon placement
problem and proposed algorithms with provable guarantees
\cite{beaconplacementtheory}.

%A complementary problem in beacon setup is to first place them and then infer their locations.  
To solve the complementary problem where we first place beacons and then map their locations, I built on algorithms in robotics and designed a pedestrian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm \cite{mobileAR}. We implemented this in the real world for mapping ultra-wideband beacons and for asset tracking with BLE tags. 

%I believe such tools for setting up systems are necessary to scale them up in a cost-effective manner.

% \paragraph{Ongoing Research in Indoor Localization. }
% %My vision for mobile indoor localization is that the future we will have a variety of technologies that operate together 
% In contrast to mobile indoor localization for augmented reality, another direction I pursued was localization under challenging environments.  
% I led the proposal of a firefighter localization project, which is funded by National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST). Our proposed system is a combination of fixed beacons on firetrucks that are automatically mapped using our SLAM algorithm; firefighters with wearable devices that range to each other; and estimation algorithms based on mobile network localization. We are exploring the possibility of exit signs as potential locations for low-power beacons in emergencies. 
% In future, I would integrate a network of drones for increasing resilience. 

% After working with several localization technologies, I was interested in analyzing how the localization stack I have developed would change if we have to re-design these systems to be robust to certain types of physical layer attacks on the ranging signals.
% I have started exploring this problem space with a security research group. % and am analyzing how the localization stack I have developed would change to be robust to certain attack models.\\

% These future smart devices necessarily have to be secure. I am interested in understanding how multiple sensor feeds can make systems more robust to physical layer attacks. The intuition is that different types of sensors have different models and we can check for consistencies among them. %systems are not usable unless secure.\\

%I believe I can draw on my experience in system modeling to re-designing systems for security. 
%Some questions I am pursuing are - how would the beacon deployment in a building change
%to guarantee robustness against attacks? Can we use consistency between various sensors and beacon measurements to detect attacks? 
%how does the device discovery and MAC layer change based on security properties of the physical layer? 

\paragraph{Other Areas in CPS. }
I have also contributed to time-synchronization \cite{buevich2013hardware, dongare2017pulsar} and non-intrusive electrical load
monitoring \cite{rajagopal2013magnetic, rajagopal2013demo}.

\section{Future Work}
%In the near-term, I would apply my indoor localization expertise to new areas. 
In the long-term I want to design resource-efficient systems and paradigms to go from sensor data to inference for emerging cyber-physical systems.
In the near-term I want to build theoretical and practical frameworks for secure, reliable end-to-end location aware systems that are integrated with next generation communication systems and support seamless interaction with objects and smart devices indoors.

%My vision for mobile indoor localization is that the future we will have a variety of technologies that operate together 
%In contrast to mobile indoor localization for augmented reality, another direction I pursued was localization under challenging environments.  
%I led the proposal for a firefighter localization research project, which is funded by National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST).

Our proposed method uses beacons deployed on firetrucks and wearable devices on firefighters, in combination with mobile network localization algorithms. I am exploring several research directions ahead, with challenges in sensing, system design and algorithms, in order for the approach to scale across buildings and be reliable in the worst firefighting scenarios.

\paragraph{Secure Localization. }
Indoor localization is imminent. However, current systems can easily
be attacked and locations can be spoofed. It is critical to make these
systems secure {\bf for them to be usable}. Secure location-awareness is
also important to enable device discovery and interaction in the
internet-of-things with heterogeneous untrusted devices.
%Security and localization are siloed domains traditionally. However, there is an opportunity in working across the domains to make localization secure, and to leverage localization and sensing for enabling secure interaction among physically co-located devices. 
%To start thinking about localization from a security-point-of-view,

%I am analyzing how to re-design the location estimation algorithms and the beacon placement algorithms for robustness to certain physical layer attacks. 
A preliminary direction for physical layer security is to use multiple sensor sources and check for consistency among them since they have different physical properties and attack models. %More broadly, I want to design future sensing systems to be secure. %A preliminary direction is that we can check for consistency among different sensors physical layer properties.

Location-awareness in next-generation communication systems can enable better use of the
spectrum by sensing the location of users, predicting channel characteristics, predicting connectivity and by creating reconfigurable arrays with mobile agents. 
Localization and imaging techniques using mmWave technology can benefit localization, indoor mapping and communication indoors.  %I am also interested in algorithms for accurate localization and tracking of mobile devices to improve resource allocation and channel prediction for communication systems. %For instance, location tracking and mobility models can predict channel characteristics and enable beam tracking. %At larger scales,
