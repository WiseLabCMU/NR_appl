I bridge theory and practice in modern Cyber-Physical Systems. %CPS. Modern cyber-physical systems require theoreticians and practitioners to work together.
Theoreticians often abstract away relevant aspects of the problem to achieve elegant results and prove important properties about their analysis and design. While some insight can still be drawn from these advancements, they usually leave a wide gap that the system designer needs to fill in order to have a working implementation. Unreliabilities occur as a consequence of unrealistic assumptions and inefficiencies arise as a consequence of non trivial constraints imposed by the real-world and finally cost is rarely taken into account. On the other hand, a complete bottom-up approach, based usually on experience and domain knowledge, is not scalable as intuition tends to fade in the face of scale and complexity. I strive to introduce systematic design principles into networked embedded sensing systems with the goal of designing inference algorithms that can achieve high reliability, cost-effectiveness and performance in Cyber-Physical Systems. Differently from both pure theoreticians and practitioners, I work close to the physical layer, and I understand its practical constraints, which I include in my models. As a consequence, my systematic approach takes advantage of the peculiar structure of the system and provides solutions that not only are near optimal according to the chosen design metric, but also readily implementable. Knowledge of the system allows me to perform opportunistic design, by extracting useful information from sensors and devices deployed for other purposes. \\

My thesis demonstrates this approach applied to several indoor localization applications, ranging from precise mobile phone localization that can be used for navigation and mobile augmented reality, to extreme systems designed for firefighting scenarios wherein multiple incomplete sources of data need to be opportunistically fused together. 
In all of this, not only did I develop reliable algorithms, but I also demonstrated the feasibility of my design in several real world deployments.
%In all of this, not only did I develop algorithms that provide performance guarantees, but I also demonstrated the feasibility of my design in several real world deployments.

\section{Indoor Localization Research}

GPS has revolutionized the way we interact with the outdoor environment.  % by providing location service. 
%Several solutions, like GPS, have emerged in the past decade for localizing mobile devices. 
Yet we don't have pervasive and accurate systems for indoor localization.  
%It is unclear if a single technology will emerge that can solve all indoor localization problems, because of the wide variability in application requirements and the constraints imposed by indoor spaces.  
It is impossible for a single technology to solve all indoor localization problems, because of the wide variation in application requirements and indoor spaces.  At the same time, it is impractical to deploy several different localization systems in all buildings at global scale. %I believe, we require a systematic approach to obtain %An ideal 
%It is unclear if a single technology will emerge that can solve all indoor localization problems, because of the wide variability in application requirements and indoor spaces.  
Working between theory and systems allows me to solve this problem in a unique manner. I build new hardware platforms by opportunistically re-using existing infrastructure and designing new sensing and signaling schemes by exploiting low-level properties of sensors. For this I draw from my theoretical knowledge to design systems. 
I then build opportunistic estimation methods that can accurately localize even in unreliable conditions, where traditional estimation techniques would fail. For this, I draw from my understanding of practical systems to design algorithms. Finally, I bridge theory and practice by building tools that  allow system installers to deploy infrastructure in a quantifiable manner. 

%My approach is to solve this problem opportunistically - to do the best with what is available. %By being opportunistic, these systems use the available devices in the environment, 
%First, I opportunistically use infrastructure (smart lighting, smart speakers, emerging internet-of-things) in novel ways to obtain location information. Second, I opportunistically integrate the available sensor sources in novel ways to get more information with less data. \\
%However, the opportunistic approach will only work when we have the minimal infrastructure required in place. Third, I build tools that can guide users to place the minimal required infrastructure and enable them to know what information they can get from the available infrastructure. Finally, I build tools for localization with where there is no fixed infrastructure. I describe these below. 

\paragraph{New Hardware Platforms. }

I designed one of the earliest visible light communication (VLC) systems to send data from overhead LED lights to phones. The phones use proximity to lights in order to determine their location.  The challenge in building this system is that in order for the lights to be flicker-free, they have to operate at a much higher frequency than what can be sampled by the camera frame rate. 
To overcome this fundamental limitation, my insight was to exploit the low-level rolling-shutter effect of camera sensors to capture a time-varying light signal as a spatially varying image. Further, I used the exposure control as a temporal filter and the focus control as a spatial filter to improve the signal-to-noise ratio \cite{rajagopal2014visual, rajagopal2014demonstration}. I extended this and leveraged the different properties of camera and photodioes to design a novel hybrid communication system where a single light simultaneously sent two independent data streams at different rates for camera and photodiodes \cite{rajagopal2014hybrid}. In this work, I applied signal processing, communication and estimation theory to networked wireless embedded systems.
%The proposed approaches generalizes to any LED-camera communication system and have been cited 170+ times. Subsequently the field of VLC has grown significantly in both academia and industry.

I also contributed to building an ultrasonic time-of-flight (ToF) platform that localizes unmodified mobile devices \cite{rtas-alps-platform, lazik2015alps,lazik2015alpsdemo}. This method is applicable for using emerging smart speakers for localization. I experimented with and characterized several emerging ToF technologies from industry including WiFi, BLE, and UWB. %I worked with Apple on emerging WiFi ToF, with Texas Instruments on emerging Bluetooth Low Energy 5 ToF, and with commodity ultra-wideband ToF systems. 
I realized that ToF ranging is promising and will eventually find its way into future smart devices.  However, ToF systems face challenges in scaling up beyond single-rooms, since the practical environmental conditions are far removed from the models assumed by theoretical algorithms. This requires new location estimation algorithms and tools that support practical system setup based on theoretical limits in localization accuracy. %with respect to location estimation and system setup. %\textit{I then tackled these challenges.} 


\paragraph{New Estimation Algorithms. } 
We have solvers for location estimation in ideal scenarios where we get measurements from multiple beacons, and have solvers for location tracking where we update the location based on prior estimation and new measurements. However, the realistic case which frequently occurs and traditional location solvers fail is  when we have to acquire the initial location without a prior and we do not have sufficient line-of-sight measurements from beacons, and to add to it, we have incorrect measurements due to non-line-of-sight measurements. To solve this, past approaches simply deploy too many beacons or do not initialize until the users walks around.

On the other hand, I opportunistically estimate location based on the available measurements and the floor plan knowledge \cite{rajagopal2018enhancing}. I use the insight that in indoor spaces, we could use the absence of measurements from beacons as useful information, and we could check for consistencies between the measurements and the floor plan. I use models that are simple enough to generalize across indoor environments and ranging technologies, yet practical enough. For instance, I model the beacon coverage using optical ray-tracing and the only assumption I make on a NLOS signal path is that it is longer than the direct path. This approach is effective since indoor spaces are not random. % and the shortest measurement is likely to be received from a LOS beacon. 
This approach significantly reduces the amount of infrastructure, and is robust. %ness of the system. 
This location estimation solver implemented on our ultrasonic platform won the Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition in 2015. % ultrasonic platform and this location estimation solver. 
%Location estimation is typically done in two stages. An initial location is first acquired and over time the location is updated with new measurements. 
%Acquiring the initial location with ToF systems is challenging in the real world, since we often have only few line-of-sight (LOS) ranges and several incorrect non-line-of-light (NLOS) ranges. Further, we don't have ways to acquire orientation instantly. 
%While past approaches deploy too many beacons, or require the user to walk around before the location converges, 
% measurements that are short and likely to be received from a LOS beacon than 
%I designed a new solver that localizes with just two LOS beacons rather than three (for 2D localization). It maintains the same performance with high NLOS \cite{rajagopal2018enhancing}.  
%My main insight was that we can integrate the floor plan while solving and use the absence of measurements from beacons as useful information. 

Another challenging practical problem on the estimation side is acquiring an initial orientation. The compass is unfortunately unreliable indoors. 
%Acquiring orientation on phones is hard since the magnetic field is unreliable indoors. 
To solve this problem,  I designed a novel approach  where we crowd-source a dense magnetic field map with mobile pedestrians by fusing data from beacons, on-board camera and inertial sensors. Subsequently, we leverage this map as a reference for instantly acquiring orientation upon startup. 
Using this concept, we built an end-to-end multi-user persistent augmented reality (AR) system \cite{mobileAR}. This work won best demo award at IPSN 2018 \cite{rajagopal2018welcome}. I extended this work to support continuous location updates. This system won the Microsoft Indoor Localization competition in 2018 with ultra-wideband beacons. 

These approaches are implemented on our ultrasonic localization system that spawned into a startup. A pilot has been deployed for AR-based product finding in a retail store.

%My insight was that

%A complementary problem in beacon setup is to first place them and then infer their locations.  
%user requirements. In order to understand the real pain points of end-users of localization, I attended a conference on mobile positioning in museums. 

%To bring order to the deployment chaos, 

\paragraph{Tools for Theory to Practice.  }
There is no systematic way to deploy localization beacons. This is often seen as an installer's problem. 
%Beacon setup at scale lacks a systematic method, is laborious and time-consuming, and does not adapt over time. 
However, by jointly designing estimation algorithms and the beacon placement approaches, and quantifying the beacon placement in terms of the localization accuracy it can provide, I place fewer beacons than typical approaches, and in addition get higher robustness while estimation location.

I designed systematic beacon placement algorithms \cite{rajagopal2016beacon}. 
My first insight was to use the floor plan geometry in a clever way to reduce the number of beacons compared to conventional placement. 
My second insight was to quantify the quality of a beacon placement by adopting the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the location estimate, which is expressed analytically by the geometry of beacons. I built on these concepts and implemented beacon placement algorithms in a toolchain where system installers can specify accuracy and coverage requirements for a floor plan and obtain a placement. 

While working on this, I found that we could apply computation geometry theory to solve these problems in a rigorous manner.  
I started collaborating with Prof. Jie Gao from Stony Brook University and her student. 
We mathematically formulated the beacon placement problem and proposed algorithms with provable guarantees \cite{beaconplacementtheory}.  

Another tool I built was for automatically mapping beacons, applicable even in scenarios where we deploy an ad-hoc localization system, and applicable to the future internet-of-things paradigm where new devices appear, disappear and move and have to be mapped. %To solve the complementary problem where we first place beacons and then map their locations, 
I built on algorithms in robotics and designed a pedestrian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm \cite{mobileAR}. We implemented this for mapping ultra-wideband beacons in several deployments and are using it for asset tracking.


\paragraph{Other Areas in CPS. }
I have also contributed to time-synchronization \cite{buevich2013hardware, dongare2017pulsar}. Time and location are both key primitives for CPS. 
Earlier, I worked on non-intrusive load monitoring \cite{rajagopal2013magnetic, rajagopal2013demo} using a wireless sensor network of electromagnetic field sensors.

%Here I developed simple yet practical models for detecting appliance states in a non-introsive .

\section{Future Work}

% In the near-term I want to build theoretical and practical frameworks for CPS indoors, for applications ranging from disaster resilience, smart buildings, to smart manufacturing or smart medical facilities. These systems should enable any user to scan the environment, discover devices, view and interact with objects and digital content in real-time. % for any information, and interact with it in real time.

\paragraph{Disaster Resilience. }
My vision is to build rapidly deployble systems as well as opportunistically leverage existing smart infrastructure to ensure safety of all persons under disasters. %that can 
%We require ways to rapidly deploy any infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. 
As a concrete step towards this, I am designing a robust system for localizing first responders in the worst fires without relying on existing infrastructure. I led the proposal for a firefighter localization project which is funded by National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST).  
Our proposed method uses beacons on firetrucks, wearable devices on firefighters, a long-range low-power wireless network, and mobile network localization and mapping algorithms. 
My next steps are to evaluate the feasibility of various technologies under smoke, develop methods to train low-accuracy inertial sensors using vision-based high accuracy sensors, integrate infrared sensors and integrate drones for increasing resilience. I am working with NIST and industry on emerging beaconing technologies that could potentially be part of all buildings in the exit signs, primarily for emergency, but also useful for bootstrapping other systems. In future, I envision smart infrastructure of cities, transport and buildings work together to increase resilience under disasters. %  using outdoor infrastructure that is part of smart cities and smart transportation smart buildings, smart cities, autonomous vehicles,

%I am analyzing how to re-design the location estimation algorithms and the beacon placement algorithms for robustness to certain physical layer attacks. 
\paragraph{Secure Sensing. }
Current sensing systems can easily be attacked since the system models do not account for attack models. It is critical to make these systems secure for them to be usable. As a first step, I am tackling the problem of secure location sensing. Secure location is also important to enable device discovery and interaction in the internet-of-things with heterogeneous untrusted devices. My early conversations with a security research group suggest that we have to re-think all layers of the localization stack starting from the physical layer design, to the location estimation, and infrastructure setup algorithms. A preliminary direction for physical layer security is to use multiple sensor sources and check for consistency among them since they have different physical properties and attack models. More broadly, I can use my approach of working across theory and systems, for re-designing sensing systems to be secure from first principles, rather than as an afterthought.

\paragraph{Integration of Next-Generation Communication, Localization, Sensing. }
\textcolor{red}{Should I make more concrete?}
Next-generation communication is critical for supporting real-time applications indoors. I am interested in integrating future sensing and localization systems with next-generation communication systems. %challenges that emerge when localization, communication and sensing co-exist.  
Location-awareness in next-generation communication systems can enable better use of the
spectrum by sensing the location of users, predicting channel characteristics, predicting connectivity and by creating reconfigurable arrays with mobile agents. Imaging and sensing techniques using mmWave technology can benefit localization, indoor mapping and communication indoors.

\paragraph{Mixed Reality. }
I believe mixed reality is an ultimate realization of CPS with tight coupling between the digital and physical worlds in real-time. What makes it more challenging and interesting is the human-in-the-loop. 
Among many challenges, mixed reality also requires accurate representation of the digital display, smart devices and physical objects in the same reference frame, for which current vision-based methods are insufficient. I would develop design principles for fusing multiple sensors, such as vision, emerging localization technologies, and VLC at the low-level to create robust mixed reality systems. As a start, I have shown how we can improve state-of-the-art mobile Augmented Reality (AR) using beacons and magnetic fields \cite{mobileAR}. More broadly, I am interested in building frameworks for integration of various sensing and actuation and interaction technologies. 
%Mixed reality is promising for interacting with future smart devices and to close the digital-physical loop in real-time. %Accurately imaging and modeling the physical world and coupling it with the digital world % and I am collaborating on a VLC-based approach for discovering AR content.

\section{Building my Research Group}
I plan to have an interdisciplinary research group. Irrespective of how each student balances theory and practice in their work, my goal is for them to have a systematic analytical approach to design and an appreciation for practical real-world implementation. I will raise funds to setup a lab that has all the hardware and infrastructure resources required for building and evaluating systems, and grow the lab over time.  While working on indoor localization, I interned at Apple's location group, worked with Texas Instruments emerging localization technology, and met with users of localization systems ranging from firefighters to museum staff who wanted to deploy localization systems. These interactions helped me think about the problem more holistically.  I will continue to keep my work grounded in real-world problems and am looking forward to diversifying into new domains with collaborations.  \\

My style of working is collaborative, I am co-advised and I have had the opportunity to be part of two research groups during my PhD. %One of my external collaborations started off with a casual discussion with a faculty at a conference, and another collaboration started off when I met a faculty who visited CMU to give a talk. % and I would encourage my students to collaborate with faculty and students in other research groups. 
In addition, I have been part of two SRC multi-university large research centers, Terraswarm and CONIX throughout my PhD. Being part of these research centers has given me the opportunity to experience first-hand the impact of collaborations across groups and universities, and build a wide network. I will create opportunities for my students to grow through such collaborations and interactions within and outside the university.  \\

Each student is unique and I will adapt my style of working to each student.  %I will build a group where each student can define their own path during their PhD. 
I had the opportunity to see my work spawn into a startup, have worked full-time in both a multi-national and a small-sized organization, have collaborated with industry research labs, and I am choosing an academic path. With this experience, I will create an environment that supports each student's own interests and goals. That said, the common goal is for students to become independent thinkers and researchers. %I will create research opportunities for undergraduate and masters students as well. I would also like to engage 
 Overall, I will create a group where students grow professionally and personally.\\

%\paragraph{Security. }
 %The system models assumed for sensing applications typically do not account for attacks at the physical layer. 
 %I am interested in understanding how multiple sensor feeds can make systems more robust to physical layer attacks. The intuition is that different types of sensors have different models and we can check for consistencies among them. %systems are not usable unless secure.\\
% %After working in the area of localization, I started thinking about what are the security implications in localization. 
 %As a start in this direction, I have started exploring this problem space with a security research group and am analyzing how the localization stack I have developed would change to be robust to certain attack models.\\ %More broadly, I believe unless these systems are secure 
% \paragraph{Security. }
% The future smart devices necessarily have to be secure. Sensing and security together open up two kinds of research challenges - first I am interested in designing sensing systems that are secure as well as designing novel sensing applications to establish secure device interactions. %for security applications such as detecting %With growing interaction between heterogeneous devices, we have to design for security from first principles, rather than including it as an after-though. I am interested in two complementaty probelms, the first is using sensing systems to authentical and attest devices,
