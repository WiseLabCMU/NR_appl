I enjoy teaching and working with students. I believe teachers and mentors play an important role in the personal and professional growth of students. I am looking forward to taking on these roles as a faculty.

\paragraph{Teaching Experience:}
At Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), I was a teaching assistant for signals and systems (undergraduate course) two semesters, wireless networks and applications (undergraduate and graduate course), and a guest lecturer for embedded systems (undergraduate course). I have assisted with ECE labs for high school students, and with science, maths and robotics classes for K-12 students through outreach initiatives. I have mentored masters students on research projects.  

\paragraph{Teaching Plan:}
The courses I am most prepared to teach are signals and systems;  digital signal processing; statistical signal processing; inference, estimation and detection; probability and random processes; digital communication; wireless networks and applications; linear systems. Other courses I can teach are embedded systems and control systems.
Some seminar courses I can teach are - Mobile sensing applications (will include augmented reality); localization and mapping (theory and applications); internet-of-things; cyber-physical-systems; 
I plan to have a project component  and possibly labs in all my classes. I would introduce discussions on research papers for my graduate classes.

\paragraph{Teaching Philosophy: }
I want students to develop the skills to think critically about solving real-world engineering problems. 
Towards this, first, they should develop a strong foundation from first principles. Second, they should develop a framework to connect various concepts to each other. This includes connecting theory to practice, connecting concepts across courses, and connecting concepts to other domains. Third, they should develop the ability to apply their skills to new problems, and be able to communicate their approach. Depending on the level of the course and students, I adapt the emphasis across these learning goals.\\


While teaching signals and systems, my goal was for students to develop a strong foundation in the mathematical concepts and an intuition of the concepts. 
I often designed homework problems by breaking them down into smaller problems. Students said this was helpful since they were able to know how to connect the concepts to solve the problem. %Sometimes I provided the solution and asked them to solve the problem. This gave them quick feedback on their technique if they .
I conducted frequent quizzes and gave them feedback, and revised my recitations based on the students understanding. %I gave them written feedback on assignments. %This informed me on what to emphasize in recitations and office hours.  
To help students develop an intuition of the concepts. I tried different approaches. %
%Students to develp an intuition of the mathematical concepts. SEe different appraoches, pr different ways of thinking about the same problem/concept.
%While teaching signals and systems, 
%my goal was for students to develop an intuition and understanding of the mathematical techniques and learn to implement them. 
I found that some while some students understood the concepts easier through illustrations, others found it easier with a purely mathematical approach. I included both approaches in my recitations and office hours. 
When students found equations confusing and wrote them incorrectly, rather than correcting them, I spent time with them one-on-one in my office hours and helped them step-through the process of interpreting what their equations meant intuitively and in the real-world. This approach helped them understand the concepts better. 
%I had a special convolution session where we went into a deep dive the topic.  
I also tried an activity in the classroom where students first solved a convolution problem, then worked in pairs and discussed their appraoch then solved another problem individually. We saw an improvement in the class performance in the second problem. One assessment of these methods was that the midterm exam performance on a difficult concept, that I had attempted many different ways to teach, was significantly better than the performance over any of the past years. \\

% Several students found convolution confusing.

In order to help students make connections between theory and practice in signals and systems,  
I introduced applied problems in my recitations and the homework assignments. We invited faculty from different areas to talk about their research. These lectures have continued since then, and every year I give a short lecture in the class about how the course content applies to my research.  I was a TA for this course in 2012 and 2015. In 2017 I got an email from the faculty that over the past few years there was a department-wide change in trend with more students taking upper-level signals courses, due to enjoying the signals and systems course. Four of us who have been a TA for this course over the years were acknowledged to have contributed to the change in trend. \\

When a TA for the wireless networks class, I designed new labs for students to experiment with the physical layer channel characteristics using various wireless platforms. 
For one of the labs, I asked students to design their own experiments, make a hypothesis about what they expect to see, and then perform the experiment and explain any differences between their hypothesis and the real-world experiments. In another lab, students experimented with channel state information. Through these labs, students learnt to connect the concepts in the class to the real-world applications and demonstrated their understanding of how the unpredictable nature of the wireless channel requires sophisticated design from the upper layers of the stack. Two groups of students subsequently defined their course project based on their interest in these initial labs. \\ 

Student motivation drives what they do. When I have flexibility in working with students individually, I first ask them what their goals are and discuss various options for moving ahead. When I was a TA for the wireless networking class, I met each student individually during the first week of class and had a conversation with them about their background courses, what their goals were for this course as well as their future plans. This understanding guided how I worked with them during the course. When I mentor students for research, I start off by defining concrete problems where they can clearly measure their progress, and gain confidence to try out harder problems. Over time we together define the research problems based on their interest. At some point they transition to working independently and start teaching me. One student who worked with me on localization got interested in robotics, and subsequently she worked an independent project in simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms and eventually joined a robotics startup. She co-authored two research papers. Another masters student I mentored on mobile augmented reality got interested in this area and took courses in vision and graphics, and subsequently joined Apple. He is a co-author on one of our papers and was part of our team that won best demo and a localization competition. I also give students feedback on how they communicate their ideas and approaches through writing, presentation or explaining concepts on a whiteboard.


 \paragraph{Outreach: } 
 At CMU, I have been active in outreach and volunteering for women in STEM. %to introduce ECE to high school women. 
One example is, I took the lead in starting a new program called mobile labs to introduce ECE to high school girls. I wrote a grant to secure funding for this program and co-led this program for two years with another PhD student. We introduced them to areas ranging from programming, micro controllers, energy harvesting, to audio processing. I felt it was important that students develop confidence with their first ECE experience. For this, I made sure the labs were designed such that all students could complete certain tasks, and were asked to reflect on what new skills they learnt. We also added bonus labs to challenge the students who wanted to explore further. We actively sought out female undergraduate students to lead most of the labs. One measurable outcome of the program was that one of the high school girls joined CMU ECE's summer program. \\

I have worked with several educational outreach programs for K-12 in both India and US in various roles - raising funds, teaching, leading programs, creating instructor manuals and volunteering. Most of these are avenues where we introduce a new domain to students in a fun hands-on manner. Through these experiences, I have learnt to adapt the teaching style to the culture, resources available, and the background knowledge of students. \\

I led a student seminar at CMU for two years to create a space where students could give practice talks and receive feedback. In this role, I started panel-based seminars to discuss topics such as teaching, fellowship, internships and job search for students overall professional growth. 

\paragraph{Learning Science: }To further my growth as a teacher, I actively seek avenues to improve my own understanding of effective teaching practices from pedagogical experts at CMU. I am among a select group (around 8 students across CMU) of graduate teaching fellows (GTF) at the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation. We have regular meetings where we discuss research in pedagogy for our own professional growth and I consult for graduate student instructors by observing their classes and providing objective constructive feedback. Being a part of a team of graduate teaching fellows and interacting with students across various departments in CMU has exposed me to teaching styles and approaches very different from what I am exposed to in engineering. I also attended an HCI course on the design of large scale peer-learning systems to learn about ways to engage students through peer-based learning in large classes. For my future classes, I am eager to try out different approaches for teaching. %
